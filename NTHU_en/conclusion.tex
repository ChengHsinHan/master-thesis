\chapter{Conclusion}
	To sum up, a collider search for the dark matter in association with a final state of $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and $b\bar{b}$, which decay from the Higgs boson candidate, was performed using 79.8 $fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded in the ATLAS at LHC. The results are in agreement with SM predictions. An exclusion on the parameter space of Z'-2HDM model is excluded, up to $m_{\mathrm{Z'}} = 2.8$ TeV and $m_{\mathrm{A}} = 300$ GeV.
