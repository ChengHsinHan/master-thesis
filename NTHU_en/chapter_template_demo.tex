\chapter{Study on the Background Estimation}
	As mentioned in the last chapter, the CRs are used to estimate the backgrounds in the SR. Because W+jets events and $t\bar{t}$ events in both SR and one-muon CR are the same processes, one assumes the kinematics are the same. As for the two-lepton CR, first note that the mass of the charged leptons and neutrinos are negligible compared to that of the Z boson. Thus, one can argue that the kinematics of the Z(ll)+jets and Z($\nu \nu$)+jets events are roughly the same, where the Z(ll) means the charged-leptonic decay of the Z boson.
	
	During the analysis, the author and Po-Shan Shih, a partner of the author, are both working on the estimation of the two-lepton CR. In this chapter, the problems that the author participated or fixed during the study are stated. Also, a shape difference of W($\mu \nu$)+jets events in SR and one-muon CR is carried out as an additional work.
	
	\section{Overlap Removal}
		The comparison plots of Monte Carlo (MC) to data are always reviewed by analyzers. Those plots are referred to as the pre-fit plots. The pre-fit plots contain the data and MC samples that pass the selection criteria. Those events are then filled in the plot based on the value of the physical quantity of interest.
		
		An unusual peak was spotted in one of the Z+jets CR plot during the analysis, as shown in figure \ref{fig:OR_before}. The plot is the distribution of the leading large-R jet mass and the peak is within 90 to 105 GeV. It is unusual because the statistics of the mass spectum should generally become less as the energy goes up. However, the peak reveals that many events assemble around a high energy value and thus creates a discontinuity.
		
		\fig[0.5][fig:OR_before][!hbt]{OR_before.png}[The plot which shows the issue of overlap removal. It shows the distribution of leading large-R jet mass. The dotted points represent the data while the solid histogram shows the MC simulations. Both of them pass the selection criteria of two-lepton CR. The spotted unusual peak lies in the bin of 90 to 105 GeV. The legends of "Z+mumu" and "Z+ee" in the upper-right of the plots are typos which weren't fixed at that time. They refer to the MC simulations of Z(ee)+jets and Z($\mu \mu$)+jets events respectively.][short caption]
		
		The bin includes the Z boson mass, which is about 91 GeV. From the Feynman diagram of the Z+jets background (\ref{fig:subfig_Zjets}) with the neutrinos replaced with leptons, one can tell that the invariant mass of the lepton pair would be close to that of a Z boson. In figure \ref{fig:OR_before}, nevertheless, it is large-R jet that has the invariant mass around it.

		Because all these events pass the two-lepton CR selections as stated in section \ref{2LCR}, one of the possible explanation to this peak is misidentification of leptons and large-R jets. It happens when they share the same track or overlap. From figure \ref{fig:OR_before}, one recognizes that the Z(ee)+jets events contributes the most in that bin. Recall the last reconstruction strategy from section \ref{OR} that an electron is removed if it it within $\Delta R = 0.1$ with a large-R jet.
		
		As a result, a check in the codes on the overlap removal (OR) was conducted, and the same plot after adding it is shown in figure \ref{fig:OR_after}. From the plot, one can see that the peak around the Z boson mass is removed. This discovery and study reveals the fact that OR wasn't properly applied at that time. After a careful check on the codes with the developer of the framework we used, the OR problem was officailly fixed.

	\section{Dealing with Large Weights}
		There are unexpected situation during real data collecting at the detector, which is not simulated by the MC. To further include these possibilities in the simulations, weights are applied. After the calculations done by MC, the raw number of events would be multiplied by these weights.
		
		Another peak was discovered in the Z+jets CR plot during the analysus, as shown in figure \ref{fig:unfixed posW}. The shown plot is also the distribution of leading large-R jet mass, but it also appears in other different plots. Following the logic in the last section, one can tell that it is unusual. However, because of the fact that OR had fixed this time and also because of this spike-like behavior exists in other kinematic variable plots, it must be a result of a different issue.
		
		As it turned out, an event was multiplied by a really high generator weight which resulted in a large contribution to the MC. The reason of this is a result of a random generation, which happens in the the type of MC generator the analyzers used. Another similar weird behavior could happen when the generator weight is negative, as shown in figure \ref{fig:unfixed negW}, which was another plot during the analysis. A clear pit shows up in the distribution where it should be continuous.

	\section{W($\mu \nu$) +jets Events Shape Comparison}
		A set of W($\mu \nu$)+jets Monte-Carlo (MC) samplesis used. In these samples, the selection fors one-muon CR and SR mentioned in the last chapter are applied. The samples after the selections of SR is used as a comparison to the one-muon CR. The reason why a comparison between W($\mu \nu$)+jets samples and data is not used is because one cannot know the truth-level comparison via it. The data after the one-muon selections would contain the $t\bar{t}$ events since they are also one of the estimation target of one-muon CR. If one adds the $t\bar{t}$ MC samples in the comparison, data and MC comparison is apple-to-apple, but one would lose the information of the shape difference on W($\mu \nu$)+jets events only.

		Because one doesn't know the yields of both samples after the selection, a normalization is used on them. After normalization, one can deduce the shape difference without any adjustment on the yields of one of them. The events are put in a histogram plot for comparison. The shape comparison for (proxy) $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and dijet invariant mass is shown in figure \ref{fig:MET_distribution} and \ref{fig:mjj_distribution}.
	
		\fig[0.5][fig:MET_distribution][!hbt]{MET_distribution.pdf}[The (proxy) $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$ distribution comparison of W($\mu \nu$)+jets in SR and one-muon CR. The upper pannel shows the distribution after normalization. The lower pannel shows the ratio of the yields in SR to one-muon CR. The auxiliary line at 200 GeV, 350 GeV, and 500 GeV is also provided (dashed blue line).][short caption]
	
		\fig[0.5][fig:mjj_distribution][!hbt]{mjj_distribution.pdf}[The dijet mass distribution comparison of W($\mu \nu)$+jets in SR and one-muon CR. The upper pannel shows the distribution after normalization. The lower pannel shows the ratio of the yields in SR to one-muon CR.][short caption]
	
		From the plots, one finds out two things. First, the shape distribution of two kinematic variables have the same trend. Second, the ratio of the distribution fluctuates around one, but in some bins it is not. One of the explanation is that the full set of selection in two different regions are not the same. From table \ref{tab:SR vs CR}, one sees that the $S_{\mathrm{object}}$ selection is applied in SR and not in one-muon CR. Thus the final events might behave differently though they are the same processes.
	
		As a result, the tendency of the kinematics variables of interest (in this case, (proxy) $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and dijet invariant mass) are roughly the same in both region. However they can not be treated equally due to one of a possible reason that the set of selections are not the same. A nuisance parameter on this shape comparison study shall be considered in the next iteration of this study.

\section{Main Uncertainties}
	The systematic uncertainties dominate the main uncertainty in this analysis. Among them, the b-tagging efficiency, the integrated luminosity, and jet energy scale (JES) and jet energy resolution (JER) contribute the most to the experimental uncertainty. The SM predictions are the sources of the theoretical uncertainties. $t\bar{t}$ events, W/Z +jets events, associated production of SM Higgs boson decay into $b\bar{b}$ (Vh($b\bar{b}$), where V is the vector boson) and diboson events dominate the theoretical uncertainties.
	
	The uncertainty on the b-tagging efficiency originate from the flavor tagging efficiency in the $t\bar{t}$ events. A calibration, which highly makes use of beam testing in LHC, on the integrated luminosity is performed with a value a 2.0\%.
	
	The theoretical uncertainties originate from the SM modeling. Normalizations, acceptance difference and differential distributions of important kinematic variables derive the uncertainties.
	
\section{Results}
	A fit to the invariant mass of Higgs candidate $m_{\mathrm{h}}$ is used to search for the signal. For resolved region, $m_{\mathrm{jj}}$ represents the Higgs mass while $m_{\mathrm{J}}$ is used in the merged region.
	
	The fit is based on a likeli-hood based approach. The systematic uncertainties are used in the likeli-hood function as nuisance parameters. The data in SR and two CRs are fit simultaneously for all four different (proxy) $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$ bins: $\left[150, 200\right)$ GeV, $\left[200, 350\right)$ GeV, $\left[350, 500\right)$ GeV, and $\left[500, \infty \right)$ GeV. $m_{\mathrm{h}}$ is the fit variable in the SR. The fit variable used in the one-muon CR is the $\mu$ lepton charge. $t\bar{t}$ processes tend to produce the same amount of $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ leptons but the W+jets events produce more $\mu^+$ than $\mu^-$ leptons, which originates from proton-proton collision in LHC and from the conservation of electric charge. $\mu$-charge can thus be made use of as a differentiation of $t\bar{t}$ and W+jets events. In the two-lepton CR, the event yields serve as the fit variable because of limited data statistics.
	
	Figure \ref{fig:MET_SR} shows the $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$ distribution in SR. Figure \ref{fig:SR_mj} shows the distribution of $m_{\mathrm{jj}}$ or $m_{\mathrm{J}}$ in SR for resolved and merged region respectively. The data yields agree with the SM predictions. That is to say, no significant excess of the signal is found.
	
	An exclusion limit at 95\% confidence level (CL) is used for the interpretation of this analysis. The exclusion contour in $(m_{\mathrm{A}}, m_{\mathrm{Z'}})$ phase space is shown in figure \ref{fig:exclusion}. It also shows the result in the previous iteration. As it suggests, more region are excluded compared to the previous result. Figure \ref{fig:signal strength} shows the comparison of the upper limit of the signal strength between this result and the previous result, in which the fixed-radius (FR) track jets are used. In contrast to VR, FR track jets have a fixed cone size of $R = 0.2$. The plot also suggests more region in the phase space is excluded.

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{result}
	To sum up, a collider search for the dark matter in association with a final state of $E_T^{\mathrm{miss}}$ and $b\bar{b}$, which decay from the Higgs boson candidate, was performed using 79.8 $fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded in the ATLAS at LHC. The results are in agreement with SM predictions. An exclusion on the parameter space of Z'-2HDM model is excluded, up to $m_{\mathrm{Z'}} = 2.8$ TeV and $m_{\mathrm{A}} = 300$ GeV.
