\chapter{Event Selection}
A number of selection, which is used to analyze whether the events have the predicted feature from the Z'-2HDM model (see fig. \ref{fig:zp2HDM}), is applied on the events. Because the final state of the model contains no leptons, one can define this region as the signal region (SR). However, there are other processes having the same final products as that of the model, which is recognized as the background. To further estimate the amount of the background events, one analyzes other processes that are similar to the background. These processes are called the control region (CR). Both SR and CR are discussed in this chapter.
